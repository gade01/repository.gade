## ABOUT TETRADUI 1.x FOR KODI 20 NEXUS
The aim with TetradUI is to create a fresh modern homage of the classic blades-style UI found in the original Xbox360 dashboard. Also seen in the works of Team Blackbolt and Jezz_X with projects MC360 and JX720 respectively. TetradUI is based from JX720 by Jezz_X.
