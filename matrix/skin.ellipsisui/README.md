About EllipsisUI
=====================================

EllipsisUI is a Graphical User Interface for Kodi, a media playback application available on multiple platforms.

The aim with EllipsisUI is to resurrect and improve Ellipsis by Team Blackbolt. EllipsisUI is a fork of the original Ellipsis project. 
The goal for Ellipsis was to make the navigation and use of Kodi as user friendly as possible, so easy to use infact that a young child can use it just as easily as her grandmother can.

Special Thanks:
==================

Special thanks to Team Kodi for continuing to develop the greatest software ever made! 
Big thanks to manfeed for all the work he's done for TeamUI as lead developer on EllipsisUI. EllipsisUI was born from a unique collaborative effort by TeamUI and was forked from the Ellipsis project by Team Blackbolt. Manfeed has done a fantastic job with the project by resurrecting and refining EllipsisUI for the world to enjoy once again, and for that I am extremely thankful.
Thanks to Team Blackbolt for the work you've all done in the past for the skinning community including the creation of the original Ellipsis.
